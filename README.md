# Documentation for development of the script

## Autogenerator of main script
Main script was autogenerated using script [generate-script-fron-config.bash](./Develop/generate-script-fron-config.bash) in `Develop` directory.

### Generation script workflow
Generation script workflow looks like following:
1. Read `config.csv` file for:
  * `state` (TRUE/FALSE),
  * `task` - task name,
  * `description` - description of task
2. Then subscripts folder and files are created (if not exist)
3. Generate `zenity` main checklist menu.
4. Generate `case` function for zenity checklist output.
5. Generate rest of code to provide `zenity` summary and errors windows.

### Autogenerator usage (for adding new features)
Modify `./Develop/config.csv` file and run:
```bash
bash ./Develop/generate-script-from-config.bash
```
After that, fill in new subscripts in `scripts` folder (if you've added one) and that's all.
